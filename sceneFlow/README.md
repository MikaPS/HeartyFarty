# Scene Flow Prototype Requirements
## Scene types 
1. Main title scene <br>
2. Credits scene <br>
3. Gameplay scene <br>
4. Menu scene <br> <br>

## Communication between scenes 
1. We communicate between scenes whether the music option has been selected on or off. We pass this data through the game scene functions. <br><br>

## Reachability
1. Our game only has one ending that is reachable when finishing the playthrough. For this prototype assignment, we included a button to press that will advance the player to the ending screen. <br><br>

## Transitions
1. One of our transitions is played by pressing one of the menu buttons. A clock will spawn from the center of the screen and rotate around while transitioning to the next scene.
