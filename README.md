## Theme
1. The game is happening in two timelines: one in the past and one in the present. It is shown with a dividing line halfway through the screen. The characters exist in the same place (the forest), but in different times. <br><br>

## Selectable requirment
1. Advanced Visual Assets - implemented a video tutorial that shows players the main mechanics and how to beat the first level (can be accessed through the tutorial button on the main menu). <br>
2. Procedural audio - we included many short audio tracks that will be played independently throughout the game, so the actions players take will decide which music track to take and add to the overall music part. Because of this the music can be divergent every time. <br>
3. Complete closed captioning - every time a new sound is played, captions describing the sound will be displayed at the bottom middle part of the screen. <br><br>
